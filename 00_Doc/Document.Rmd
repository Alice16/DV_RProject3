For this project, several csv files contain related information about Texas legislators and their comittees were imported into a remote OracleDB.

##Importing Dataframes
The first step is to initialize the required packages for this project
```{r}
source("../01_Data/Packages.R", echo=TRUE)
```

Next, we will build our dataframe. We grab the data from the Oracle Database with a SQL query. The following dataframe shown is the head of the whole dataframe.
```{r}
source("../01_Data/Dataframe.R", echo=TRUE)
